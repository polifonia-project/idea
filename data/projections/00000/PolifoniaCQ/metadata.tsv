Search operations should be expressed on either raw-level features (eg melodic lines) or higher-level features (eg modes, cadences, triad patterns, etc.). The systm should retrieve efficiently all sources that match the search pattern, and identifiy pattern occurrences	Sethus
A subset can be hierarchically refined based on criteria independant from on another and independant from the initial search pattern. The user can navigate in this hierarchy and refine the search.	Sethus
At each step, the result set takes the form of a subcorpus organized according to rich relationships, and enriched with user annotations	Sethus
A result set can be stored (in intention, not in extension) as a Relevant Corpus, and its definition can be revised at any moment	Sethus
navigating through a Relevant Corpus is based on anotation and search patterns	Sethus
To which modes Vide homo has been assigned to in Tonalities? Leonhard, Bernhard, Harold, Siegfried, Frans and Alexander relate the motet to the tonus peregrinus. Robert, however, considers the work to be written in the mixolydian mode.	Sethus
Are the criteria on which these interpretations are based true in the score and, if so, to what extent? ; - What are the cadence points in the work? ; - What are the part’s ranges? Do they correspond to modal octaves? ; - What is the final of the bassus? ; - What is the last chord? ; - Are there any melodic patterns related to modality? ; - To what diatonic environment does the work belong to? ; - What are the part’s clefs and keys? ; - Are the theoretical models on which these criteria are based – for example the Zarlinian cadential scheme ^1-^3-^5 – in line with this work? ; - What is the tension between the expected theoretical criteria and their actual realisation in the work?	Sethus
Can one assume that the modal ambiguity evidenced by the analytical interpretations is intended? Harold sees, for example, the use of modes in Lagrime as a religious symbol.

Can these hypotheses be substantiated on the basis of Polifonia's analytical and heritage knowledge? ; - Where does the work appear within the cycle? ; - What do we know about this cycle and its place in Lassus' output? ; - Which poetic text is set to music? ; - Has this poetic text been set to music before?
