# Problematic CQs

At the current stage, some competency questions still need to be refined. This page provides an overview of those requiring more attention, and will be updated as soon as changes are made to the stories/CQs.


## Known issues

At the moment, we are using a simple taxonomy for possible inconsistencies in the competency questions. However, this does not provide a full check-up of a CQ, which can still be ill-formulated despite passing our preliminary checks.

In the table below, you will find a list "problematic CQs" where the last column uses a list of tags to describe the type of inconsistency. Current tags include:

- **incomplete** if the CQ is not formulated as an actual question ("?" is missing);
- **to-split** if more questions are identified within the same CQ (too many "?"s);
- **complex** whenever a CQ uses lists, or other sub-statements (potentially to-split);
- **hard** is more of a *warning* rather than an error, and is currently raised when using more than 120 characters.

The latest full version of the table is reported below, and is also available for download at [this link](https://github.com/polifonia-project/idea/blob/main/data/cq_with_issues.csv).

| Sethus    | 1_ConflictingTheoreticalInterpretations | CQ3  | Can one assume that the modal ambiguity evidenced by the analytical interpretations is intended? Harold sees, for example, the use of modes in Lagrime as a religious symbol. Alexander suggests that Tansillo's texts set to music by Lassus can be read as an examination of conscience, advocated by post-Tridentine spirituality. Can these hypotheses be substantiated on the basis of Polifonia's analytical and heritage knowledge?  | ['to-split', 'complex', 'hard'] |
