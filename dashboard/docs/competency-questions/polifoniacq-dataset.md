# The PolifoniaCQ dataset

The PolifoniaCQ dataset comprehend all the competency questions that have been contributed so far within the Polifonia project. It is an ongoing effort to iteratively improve the corpus of questions, to facilitate the design, development and testing of ontologies. This allows to link elements of design (then triples) back to competency questions.

> :floppy_disk: The latest version of the dataset is currently available in CSV format at [this link](https://github.com/polifonia-project/idea/blob/main/data/cq_sanity_checks.csv). 

An excerpt of the dataset is given in the table below.
